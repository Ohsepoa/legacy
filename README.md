Modules

Extensibility
===
You can add functions to your website by installing modules. Modules can be easily add by installation wizard.
XOOPS Cube 2.1 has high compatibility with the earlier XOOPS 2.0.x. We recommend the last modules generation, known as Cube modules and D3 modules which can be easily duplicated and renamed but also provide a GUI to manage the language catalog and templates. You can choose from over 100 of free modules at your needs.
XOOPS Cube functionality can also be easily extended with Preloads - one file based extension.
